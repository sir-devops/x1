Adding New suff 
and more bla bla

There comes a time,
When you face the truth alone,
The greatest challenge to believe,
And with the help from those,
Who give you strength of mind,
Stand up and fight your battle,
Leaving your own inhibitions behind.
Stand on your own,
There's no retreat, there's no surrender,
Stand on your own,
For you must do what your heart tells you,
Stand on your own,
And when your dreams,
And your frustrations work
Themselves through,
There'll be no stopping you.
Your honor is nothing,
If you fight but watch inside,
And don't believe in yourself,
So search at your feelings
And prod the man of you
You have a dream,
And thats your power
So throw out the old ones
And accepting the new.
Stand on your own,
There's no retreat, there's no surrender,
Stand on your own,
For you must do what your heart tells you,
Stand on your own,
And when your dreams,
And your frustrations work
Themselves though,
Therell be no stopping you.
